1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,925
Well, consider this. If you're in the wrong area,

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:05,115
you would like the line to go over you,

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:06,510
in order to be in the right area.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,930
Thus, the points just come closer!

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,000
So the line can move towards it and eventually classify it correctly.
