1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,575
The prediction is basically the answer we get from the algorithm.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:06,220
A discreet answer will be of the form yes, no.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,257
Whereas a continued answer will be a number,

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:11,615
normally between zero and one which we'll consider a probability.

5
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,225
In the running example,

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:16,665
here we have our students where blue is accepted and red is rejected.

7
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:21,035
And the discrete algorithm will tell us if a student is accepting or rejecting

8
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:25,680
by typing a zero for rejected students and a one for accepted students.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,275
On the other hand,

10
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,835
the farther our point is from the black line,

11
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:32,505
the more drastic these probabilities are.

12
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,240
Points that are well into the blue area get very high probabilities,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,050
such as this point with an 85 percent probability of being blue.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,885
And points that are well into the red region are given very low probabilities,

15
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:48,160
such as this point on the bottom that is given a 20 percent probability of being blue.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,430
The points over the line are all given a 50 percent probability of being blue.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,335
As you can see the probability is a function of the distance from the line.

18
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:00,390
The way we move from discrete predictions to continuous,

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,075
is to simply change your activation function from the step function in the left,

20
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,655
to the sigmoid function on the right.

21
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,610
The sigmoid function is simply a function which for

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,630
large positive numbers will give us values very close to one.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,220
For large negative numbers will give us values very close to zero.

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,030
And for numbers that are close to zero,

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,600
it'll give you values that are close to point five.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,685
The formula is sigmoid effects equals one divided by one plus e to the minus x.

27
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:38,245
So, before our model consisted of a line with a positive region and a negative region.

28
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:42,010
Now it consists of an entire probability space or for each point in the plane

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,045
we are given the probability that the label of the point is one for the blue points,

30
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,970
and zero for the red points.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,370
For example, for this point the probability of

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,850
being blue is 50 percent and of being red is 50 percent.

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,510
For this point, the probabilities are 40 percent for being blue,

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,975
and 60 percent for being red.

35
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:06,447
For this one over here it's 30 percent for blue,

36
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:08,470
and 70 percent for red.

37
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,440
And for this point all over here is 80 percent for being

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,655
blue and 25 percent for being red.

39
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,360
The way we obtain this probability space is very simple.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
We just combine the linear function W x plus b with the sigmoid function.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,830
So in the left we have the lines that represent the points for which W x plus b is zero,

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,630
one, two, minus one, minus two, etcetera.

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,930
And once we apply the sigmoid function to each of these values in the plane,

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,515
we then obtain numbers from zero to one for each point.

45
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:44,075
These numbers are just the probabilities of the point being blue.

46
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,440
The probability of the point being blue is a prediction of

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,455
the model Y hat to sigmoid of W x plus b.

48
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:53,415
Here we can see the lines for which the prediction is point five,

49
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,260
point six, point seven,

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,420
point four, point three, et cetera.

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,540
As you can see, as we get more into the blue area,

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,905
sigmoid of W x plus b gets closer and closer to one.

53
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,740
And as we move into the red area,

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,115
sigmoid of W x plus b get closer and closer to zero.

55
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,240
When we're over the main line,

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,120
W x plus b is zero,

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,320
which means sigmoid of W s plus b is exactly zero point five.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,385
So here on the left we have our old Perceptron with

59
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,250
the activation function as a step function.

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,670
And on the right we have our new Perceptron,

61
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,945
where the activation function is the sigmoid function.

62
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,985
What our new Perceptron does,

63
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,195
it takes the inputs,

64
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:38,302
multiplies them by the weights in the edges and adds the results,

65
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,935
then applies the sigmoid function.

66
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:45,170
So instead of returning one and zero like before it returns

67
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,985
values between zero and one such as point nine nine or point six seven et cetera.

68
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,285
Before it used to say the student got accepted or not,

69
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:58,000
and now it says the probability of the student got accepted is this much.
