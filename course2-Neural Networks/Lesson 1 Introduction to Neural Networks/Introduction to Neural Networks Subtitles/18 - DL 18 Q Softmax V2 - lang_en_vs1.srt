1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
Let's switch to a different example for a moment.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,365
Let's say we have a model that will predict if you receive a gift or not.

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:09,220
So, the model use predictions in the following way.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,565
It says, the probability that you get a gift is 0.8,

5
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:18,760
which automatically implies that the probability that you don't receive a gift is 0.2.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,265
And what does the model do?

7
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,450
What the model does is take some inputs.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,065
For example, is it your birthday or have it been good all year?

9
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,580
And based on those inputs,

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,105
it calculates a linear model which would be the score.

11
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:34,090
Then, the probability that you get the gift or not

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,350
is simply the sigmoid function applied to that score.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,540
Now, what if you had more options than just getting a gift or not a gift?

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,805
Let's say we have a model that just tell us what animal we just saw,

15
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,090
and the options are a duck,

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,890
a beaver and a walrus.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,015
We want a model that tells an answer along the lines of,

18
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,790
the probability of a duck is 0.67,

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,580
the probability of a beaver is 0.24,

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,690
and the probability of a walrus is 0.09.

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,320
Notice that the probabilities need to add to one.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,378
Let's say we have a linear model based on some inputs.

23
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:12,375
The inputs could be, does it have a beak or not?

24
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,800
Number of teeth. Number of feathers.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
Hair, no hair. Does it live in the water? Does it fly?

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,750
Etc. We calculate linear function based on those inputs,

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,210
and let's say we get some scores.

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,520
So, the duck gets a score of two,

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,555
and the beaver gets a score of one,

30
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,975
and the walrus gets a score of zero.

31
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,340
And now the question is,

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,940
how do we turn these scores into probabilities?

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,690
The first thing we need to satisfy with probabilities is as we said,

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,540
they need to add to one.

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,840
So the two, the one,

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,500
and the zero do not add to one.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,720
The second thing we need to satisfy is,

38
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,460
since the duck had a higher score than the beaver

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,205
and the beaver had a higher score than the walrus,

40
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:57,555
then we want the probability of the duck to be higher than the probability of the beaver,

41
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:02,150
and the probability of the beaver to be higher than the probability of the walrus.

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,060
Here's a simple way of doing it.

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,135
Let's take each score and divide it by the sum of all the scores.

44
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,847
The two becomes two divided by two plus one plus zero,

45
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:15,950
the one becomes one divided by two plus one plus zero,

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,645
and the zero becomes zero divided by two plus one plus zero.

47
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:25,220
This kind of works because the probabilities we obtain are two thirds for the duck,

48
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,885
one third for the beaver,

49
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:29,420
and zero for the walrus.

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,850
That works but there's a little problem. Let's think about it.

51
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,745
What could this problem be?

52
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:35,610
The problem is the following.

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,295
What happens if our scores are negative?

54
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,930
This is completely plausible since the scores are

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,250
linear function which could give negative values.

56
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,070
What if we had, say, scores of 1, 0 and (-1)?

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,830
Then, one of the probabilities would turn into one divided by

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,864
one plus zero plus minus one which is zero,

59
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:55,930
and we know very well that we cannot divide by zero.

60
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,929
This unfortunately won't work,

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,720
but the idea is good.

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,695
How can we turn this idea into one that works all the time even for negative numbers?

63
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:10,540
Well, it's almost like we need to turn these scores into positive scores.

64
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,850
How do we do this?

65
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,300
Is there a function that can help us?

66
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,910
This is the quiz. Let's look at some options.

67
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,090
There's sine, cosine, logarithm, and exponential.

68
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,220
Quiz. Which one of these functions will turn every number into a positive number?

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,000
