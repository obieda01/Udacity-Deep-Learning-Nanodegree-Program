1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Well we're getting somewhere now.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,100
We've concluded that the probability is important.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,970
And that the better model will give us a better probability.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,545
Now the question is,

5
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:13,110
how we maximize the probability.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,560
Also, if remember correctly we're talking about an error function and how

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,830
minimizing this error function will take us to the best possible solution.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,070
Could these two things be connected?

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,363
Could we obtain an error function from the probability?

10
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:29,750
Could it be that maximizing the probability is equivalent

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,000
to minimizing the error function? Maybe.
