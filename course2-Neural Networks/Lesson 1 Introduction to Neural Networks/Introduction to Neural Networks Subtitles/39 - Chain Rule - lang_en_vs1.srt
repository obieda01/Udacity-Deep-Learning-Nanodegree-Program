00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
So before we start calculating derivatives,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,980
let's do a refresher on the chain rule which

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,080
is the main technique we'll use to calculate them.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,390
The chain rule says, if you have a variable X on a function F that you

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,825
apply to X to get F of X, which we're gonna call A,

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,810
and then another function G,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,605
which you apply to F of X to get G of F of X,

8
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:26,760
which we're gonna call B, the chain rule says,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,920
if you want to find the partial derivative of B with respect to X,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,685
that's just a partial derivative of B with respect to

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:41,705
A times the partial derivative of A with respect to X.

12
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:43,185
So it literally says,

13
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:47,605
when composing functions, that derivatives just multiply,

14
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,345
and that's gonna be super useful for us because

15
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:55,185
feed forwarding is literally composing a bunch of functions,

16
00:00:55,185 --> 00:01:00,555
and back propagation is literally taking the derivative at each piece,

17
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:03,345
and since taking the derivative of a composition

18
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:06,756
is the same as multiplying the partial derivatives,

19
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,290
then all we're gonna do is multiply a bunch of

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,130
partial derivatives to get what we want. Pretty simple, right?
